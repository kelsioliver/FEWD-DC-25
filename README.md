# FEWD25 Course Repository
Welcome to Front-End Web Development (FEWD) at General Assembly! This is where we will be hosting all class slides, assignments, starter code, and more.

## Communication
General Assembly's gives every class its own Slack chatroom - here is ours: [FEWD 25 Slack Channel](https://fewddc25.slack.com). It's the best way to get ahold of your instructors. You should have received an invitation but if not, let John or Tim know and we can get you in there.

Slack is channel based; if you have questions that would benefit everyone, ask them in the *#general* channel. Missing class? Of course not, but give us a heads up in *#missing-class*. We'll also post useful resources in *#useful-resources*. You can also contact instructors, TAs and classmates directly using the tool.

## Tools and Resources
During this course, there are a number of tools you will be expected to have and others we think you'll want to have. Have a look:

### Required Tools
* [Slack](https://slack.com/downloads) - Desktop application for our class chatroom (**please disable audio notifications!**).

* [Chrome Browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/) - Default browser for the class.

### Recommended Tools
* [Codepen](https://codepen.io) - Do front-end development in the browser! We'll also be showing you many live examples in Codepen so it would be good to at least familiarize yourself with it if you don't plan on signing up.
* [Dashlane](https://dashlane.com) - My favorite password management tool. Get used to saving passwords if you want to be a professional front-end dev.
* [Trello](https://trello.com) - The best task management tool on the internet. This would be a great way for you to organize your final project.

## Meet the Team
### John Serrao (Instructor)
John is a displaced Texan who's been up in the national capital leading large-scale web development projects for the last ten years. His interests in this field are focused on improving user experience in scalable web applications that address real-world needs. One of his longer-term goals is to unite the worlds of medicine and agriculture with scalable, technological solutions that dramatically bring down the cost of quality food and help reverse the trend of chronic disease in the United States.

### Caitlin Daitch (TA)
Caitlin Daitch is currently a Front-End Web Developer at Fundrise in Dupont Circle. She was formerly a Digital Producer/Project Manager at a local digital agency and decided to switch careers after taking FEWD15. She graduated from General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program in April and is now a full-time web developer. Fun fact: her former FEWD instructor is now her boss at Fundrise!

### Erica Irving (TA)
Erica Irving is a Front-End Web Developer at The Washington Post. She graduated from General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program in September 2015, then worked at GA as a developer-in-residence for the October-January cohort. 

### Tim Foley (Course Producer)
As your Course Producer, it's Tim's job to make sure that you (and your instructors) have everything you need for a successful experience in FEWD. **If you've got a question, and you're not sure who to ask, start with Tim!**

Before GA, Tim lived and worked in China as a facilitator and program-designer for youth-leadership programs at international schools all over Asia (e.g. student-council retreats, backpacking trips, etc.). After a year abroad, he was ready to move back to the good ol' USA. Tim started out at the front desk as a member of GA's Front Lines team, moved up to "Campus Commander" (yes, a real title), and then as a full-time Course Producer. In addition to FEWD, Tim also produces BEWD, Data Science, Analytics, Mobile Development, and Digital Marketing. Tim has been trying to learn Esperanto since high school.
